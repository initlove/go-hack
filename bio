Chenye has over ten years open source experience, very active in open source communities, like GNOME, openSUSE.

Chenye has been involved in contributing to OCI community since August 2015. He joins the discussion of OCI Specification in mailing list and weekly meeting and participates in the OCI tool development. To achieve the OCI goal of having an open standard in container technologies, a standard test suite is very important. Chenye created a testing project (OCT) to ensure a runtime or an image is OCI compliant. As the OCI testing owner, he keeps the testing project updating with OCI spec, testing on hottest container runtime and send feedback to them. It is an efficient way to expand the OCI influence and make it a well accepted standard. 

With the strong enthusiasm and community ability, Chenye will strive to reflect, adhere and promote the OCI values.
