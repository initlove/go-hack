Why are you doing this now?

At CoreOS we have large, serious users running in enterprise environments. 
We cannot in good faith continue to support Dockerâ€™s broken security model without addressing these issues.
Additionally, in the past few weeks Docker has demonstrated that it is on a path to include many facilities
beyond basic container management, turning it into a complex platform. Our primary users have existing platforms
that they want to integrate containers with.
We need to fill the gap for companies that just want a way to securely and portably run a container.


Application containers are useful because they put developers in full control of the exact versions of software
dependencies for their applications. This reduces surprises that can arise because of discrepancies between different
environments (like development, test, and production), while freeing the underlying OS from worrying about shipping 
software specific to the applications it will run.
This decoupling of concerns increases the ability for the OS and application to be serviced for updates and security patches.
